# Stack Up Bounty Challenge - Akshar  

## Background Changing Widget

For the bounty challenge, I added a widget that allowed users to change background image of the web app. 
As a user who is using the planner for themselves, the background changing widget fits very well as they can add a family photo or some motivational pic to the background for a plwsant experience with the planner. The app for the bounty can be found via the link: https://akshar-planner-bounty-app.web.app/ .  

## Instructions

Apart from the widgets at front, users need to add the widget by clicking on '+ Add Widget' and then clicking on Change Background widget. Then they have to click on 'Choose A File' to input an image (jpg/png format). Once the image is uploaded, it will be shown on the widget via the FileReader object. After that, user will see a button which will allow them to use the image as background image upon clicking it.

## Miscellanous  

In case the background app changes white or doesn't change after uploading your image and clicking on the button, just click on the button 'Click to change Background Image' again or just upload your image again and then click to see your desired image as the background image.
